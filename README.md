Project Description
This e-commerce project consists of a comprehensive platform including an Admin Panel and a Native Application. The admin panel, built with React.js, allows for efficient management of orders, products, and rental centers. The native application, developed using Expo, offers users a seamless shopping experience with advanced features such as search, filters, cart management, and secure payments through Stripe. Additionally, the app includes functionalities for product rentals, wishlist management, and user profile maintenance.
